# Tasks for Week 2:
- Design a 2-bit full adder
- Write testbench and verify functionality
- Familiarise yourself with the syntax and operators.

## OPERATORS
### Arithmetic Operators
The arithmetic operators are as follows:

- +(addition)
- -(subtraction)
- *(multiplication)
- /(division)
- %(modulus, or remainder).
### Logical Operators
There are a number of logical operators. Logical operators act on an entire value (multiple bits), and treat the values of "zero" as being "false", and "non-zero" as being "true".

- !(Logical NOT)
- &&(Logical AND)
- ||(Logical OR)

### Bitwise Operators
There are a number of bitwise operators to perform boolean operations on each individual bit in a bus.

- ~(Bitwise NOT)
- &(Bitwise AND)
- |(Bitwise OR)
- ^(Bitwise XOR)
- ~^(Bitwise XNOR)
### Assignment Operators
There are three assignment operators, each of which performs different tasks, and are used with different data types:

- assign(continuous assignment)
- <=(non-blocking assignment)
- =(blocking assignment)
